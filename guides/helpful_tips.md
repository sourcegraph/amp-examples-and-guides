üí° Amp Coding Tip 1: Meet Oracle - Your New Code Review Partner
"Oracle" - a powerful code analysis tool powered by OpenAI's o3 model that works alongside your main coding agent. Think of it as having a senior developer looking over your shoulder!
When to use Oracle:
  
* Code reviews: ```"Use the oracle to review the last commit's changes"```
* Debugging tricky issues: ```"Help me fix this bug. Use the oracle as much as possible"```
* Refactoring complex code: ```"Work with the oracle to figure out how we can refactor this duplication"```

Pro tip: Oracle requires explicit prompting - it won't activate automatically. Just mention "use the oracle" in your requests when you need that extra analytical power for complex coding challenges.
It's slower than Amp's main agent but incredibly thorough for analysis tasks. Perfect for those moments when you need a second pair of eyes on critical code! üîç
