# Command Piping

Command piping is a powerful feature in the terminal that allows you to connect the output of one command to the input of another command. This can be used to create complex workflows and automate tasks.

Using [`amp --execute`](https://ampcode.com/news/amp-x), you can send the output of any shell command to Amp to quickly create agentic workflows.


## Code Linting

Amp can quickly cleanup linting issues identified by a projects existing code linting configuration.

`bun run lint | amp -x 'apply fixes for the identified linting issues`
