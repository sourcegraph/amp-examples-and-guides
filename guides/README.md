## Common Use Cases & Workflows

This document outlines workflows and example for Amp usage to help you through all phases of SDLC.

* Plan - Analyse, explore, and strategize your development approach with intelligent codebase understanding
* Build - Implement, refactor, and enhance your code with AI-assisted development and testing
* Depoy - Streamline your deployment pipeline with automated workflows and quality gates
* Support - Maintain, secure, and collaborate on your deployed applications with ongoing optimisation
