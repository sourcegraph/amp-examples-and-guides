# Testing Principles

## Behavior-Driven Testing
- **No "unit tests"** - this term is not helpful. Tests should verify expected behavior, treating implementation as a black box
- Test through the public API exclusively - internals should be invisible to tests
- No 1:1 mapping between test files and implementation files
- Tests that examine internal implementation details are wasteful and should be avoided
- **Coverage targets**: 100% coverage should be expected at all times, but these tests must ALWAYS be based on business behaviour, not implementation details
- Tests must document expected business behaviour

## Test Data Pattern
Use factory functions with optional overrides for test data:

```typescript
const getMockPaymentPostPaymentRequest = (
  overrides?: Partial<PostPaymentsRequestV3>
): PostPaymentsRequestV3 => {
  return {
    CardAccountId: "1234567890123456",
    Amount: 100,
    Source: "Web",
    AccountStatus: "Normal",
    LastName: "Doe",
    DateOfBirth: "1980-01-01",
    PayingCardDetails: {
      Cvv: "123",
      Token: "token",
    },
    AddressDetails: getMockAddressDetails(),
    Brand: "Visa",
    ...overrides,
  };
};
