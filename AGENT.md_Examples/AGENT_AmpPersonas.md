### Advanced Usage

#### Persona Combinations

Some tasks benefit from multiple persona perspectives. You can manually invoke different personas for the same problem:

```
/as security-expert analyze auth.js for vulnerabilities
/as performance-engineer analyze auth.js for bottlenecks
/as senior-engineer review auth.js for maintainability
```

#### Context-Aware Auto-Activation

Personas can auto-activate based on:
- **Keywords in user messages**
- **File types and extensions**
- **Project context and patterns**
- **Previous conversation context**

### Best Practices

#### When to Use Personas

**Use personas when:**
- You need domain-specific expertise
- Different perspectives would be valuable
- Communication style matters for the context
- Specialized tools or methodologies are needed

**Don't use personas when:**
- Simple, straightforward tasks
- Default behavior is sufficient
- Persona switching would add unnecessary complexity

#### Persona Selection Guidelines

**Let auto-activation work first** - The system will choose appropriate personas based on context.

**Override when needed:**
- You want a specific perspective
- Auto-activation chose incorrectly
- You're learning from different viewpoints
- Complex problems need multiple expert views
